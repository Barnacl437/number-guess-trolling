# number-guess-trolling
It's just a small game written in Python, code copied from a meme macro. It's all about guessing number 1 to 10, and if you lose, you may lose your System32 folder (and your beloved stuff storing inside it). Just for fun, however, I have never tested it. Do with caution, if it has enough permission, it may be destructible to your system files.
