# number-guess-trolling 
(aka Russian Roulette Game, but instead of shooting your head your System32 will be the target in a system-free campaign)

It's just a small game written in Python, code copied from a meme macro. It's all about guessing number 1 to 10, and if you lose, your System32 folder may also do the same (and your beloved stuff storing inside it). Just for fun, however, I have never tested it. Do with caution, if it has enough permission, it may be destructible to your system files.

p/s: say, this thing may never be able to harm your PC, cuz the system is very hard-protected. You might only get lucks trolling someone by deleting their personal folders, but don't do so. It's bad. Everything here is for archival purpose.
